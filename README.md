### Study procedure

| Task                          | Time   | Time out of 60 | Description                                                                                             |

| **Interview**     | 15     | 60            | Conduct an interview with four prepared questions and collect additional comments. |

### Task notebooks

Participants were assigned one of four versions of the task notebook. A task notebook consists of two sections, each consisting of three tasks, and one fill in the blank task at the end. The two sections in the same notebook use different but structurally similar dataset. One section provides step-by-step diagrams for the code, while the other section provides default Python output. The three tasks in the two sections correspond one by one, with similar topics and structures. The tasks are randomly shuffled within one section and named with Greek letters.

#### Notebook Versions

| Version | First Section                | Dataset | Second Section            | Dataset |
|---------|-------------------------------|---------|----------------------------|---------|
| A       | Default Output                | Sales   | Step-By-Step Diagram       | Student |
| B       | Default Output                | Student | Step-By-Step Diagram       | Sales   |
| C       | Step-By-Step Diagram          | Sales   | Default Output             | Student |
| D       | Step-By-Step Diagram          | Student | Default Output             | Sales   |

#### Tasks

| Sales Task | Student Task |
|------------|--------------|
| epsilon    | theta        |
| zeta       | gamma        |
| lambda     | kappa        |

### Participant Response Form

Participants were asked to describe their understanding of the code in each of the tasks, then record their description as well as their self-perceived confidence level for the task in a Google form ([Template](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe9Qxz3RSC1ZNapNS1LShJF28lUFAWzCM2njkyKgp0Z4d2iZg/viewform?usp=sharing)).
